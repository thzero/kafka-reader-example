# Application Requirements

## Assumptions

### Platform & Build
- Java / Spring Boot application built with Gradle
- Deployable as 10 concurrent instances on a Kafka cluster

### Message Structure
- Every message is a JSON envelope with two top-level properties:
  - **`event`** — header/metadata object containing:
    - `interactionId` — unique identifier for the interaction; used as the correlation ID for all logging
    - `eventType` — the type/category of the event
  - **`body`** — payload object containing:
    - `messageId` — unique identifier for the message; used in control records and dead letter records
- Both `event` and `body` must be deserialized into strongly-typed Java objects
- `interactionId` must be propagated through the entire processing lifecycle (logging, control records, dead letter)

### Throughput & Scalability
- Must sustain a minimum of 1,000,000 messages per day (~12 msg/sec average; must handle burst capacity above this)
- Concurrency and thread pool sizes must be configurable via application properties

### Kafka Reading
- No duplicate messages may be processed; each `messageId` must be handled exactly once
- Deduplication is enforced via **Kafka exactly-once semantics (EOS)**:
  - Consumer is configured with `isolation.level=read_committed` — only reads messages from committed transactions
  - Producer is configured as a **transactional producer** with a unique `transactional-id` per instance
  - The consumer-to-producer flow operates within a single Kafka transaction — the input read and output publish either both commit or both roll back
- If a duplicate `messageId` is detected despite EOS (e.g., a replayed message), it must be routed to the Dead Letter Component with reason code `DUPLICATE`
- Duplicate detection uses a **two-layer approach** to keep the consumer thread free of DB round-trips:
  1. **In-memory gate (consumer thread)** — `ConcurrentHashMap.newKeySet()` holds all in-flight `messageId`s; `add()` returns `false` if already present, making in-flight duplicate detection a nanosecond operation with zero DB cost. The set is cleared on restart.
  2. **DB unique constraint (worker thread)** — `ReceivedRecord` has a unique constraint on `message_id`. If the constraint fires (`DataIntegrityViolationException`) during `recordReceived()` on the worker thread, it means the app restarted mid-flight (in-memory state lost, row survived). Route to dead letter + ack.
- The in-flight set is removed from in the worker's `finally` block — on success (allows explicit replay) and on failure (allows redelivery after no-ack)
- To replay a failed message: delete its `ReceivedRecord` row, then replay the Kafka message; the constraint insert will succeed and the message will be processed normally

## Capabilities

### Kafka Consumer
- Listens to a configured Kafka input topic
- Uses a shared, common `groupId` across all 10 instances for coordinated partition consumption
- Manual acknowledgment (`enable.auto.commit=false`) — offsets are committed only after successful downstream publish
- Processes messages concurrently (multi-threaded / async processing per message)
- Consumer thread count per instance is configurable via `kafka.consumer.concurrency`
- The correct value is `partitions ÷ instances` — e.g., 10 partitions across 10 instances = `concurrency: 1`; setting it higher wastes idle threads

### Message Processing
- Message payloads are JSON; deserialization must be handled on ingest
- Upon successful deserialization, the message is scheduled for deferred processing
- When the consumer thread receives a message it first checks the **in-memory in-flight set** (`ConcurrentHashMap`) for the `messageId`; if already present it is a duplicate — route to DUPLICATE dead letter and ack. If not present, the ID is added to the set and the work is scheduled for deferred execution. No DB call happens on the consumer thread.
- When the worker thread fires and processing actually begins, `ControlService.recordReceived()` is called first (DB INSERT with unique constraint), then processing proceeds — `RECEIVED` represents "processing started"; a `ReceivedRecord` with no matching `PublishedRecord` in reconciliation jobs indicates a genuine processing failure
- Each message is processed independently and in a concurrent fashion
- After successful processing, the message is serialized back to JSON and published to a configured Kafka output topic
- Upon successful publish, the Control Component is invoked to write a `PUBLISHED` control record
- Offset commit to the input topic is performed only after the output publish and control record write complete successfully
- Any failure at any stage (deserialization, processing, publish, or control record write) is handed off to the Dead Letter Component
- Must delay processing by at least 20 seconds (configurable via `app.processing.delay-ms`) to account for upstream race conditions
- The delay is implemented using a `ScheduledExecutorService` — the consumer thread schedules the deferred work and returns immediately, so many messages can be waiting out their delay simultaneously without blocking the consumer
- The number of worker threads in the scheduler is configurable via `app.processing.worker-threads`; size it to handle the maximum number of in-flight messages during the delay window (e.g., 12 msg/sec × 20s = 240 threads)
- This delay is NOT a Kafka setting — Kafka delivers messages instantly; the delay is introduced by our scheduling logic in `KafkaConsumerListener`

### Control Records
- A dedicated **Control Component** is responsible for persisting control records to a database
- Use an in-memory database (e.g., H2) for the initial implementation; the data source must be swappable via configuration
- Control records are stored in **two separate tables** with distinct semantics:
  - **`received_record`** (`ReceivedRecord` entity) — written on the consumer thread immediately after deserialization; has a **unique constraint on `message_id`** which serves as the atomic duplicate guard
    - Fields: `messageId`, `interactionId`, `receivedAt`
  - **`published_record`** (`PublishedRecord` entity) — written after successful publish; no unique constraint
    - Fields: `messageId`, `interactionId`, `publishedAt`
- If an exception occurs at any stage (processing or publishing), the Control Component must **not** write a `PublishedRecord`; the failure is instead routed to the Dead Letter component
- Control Component must be a standalone, injectable service; it must not contain Kafka or processing logic directly

### Error Handling & Dead Letter
- Any exception raised during message processing or during Kafka output publishing is routed to a **Dead Letter Component**
- The Dead Letter Component receives and persists:
  - The original message payload as received from the input topic
  - A `reasonCode` (string/enum) describing the category of failure (e.g., `PROCESSING_ERROR`, `PUBLISH_ERROR`, `DESERIALIZATION_ERROR`)
  - A `messageId` where extractable
  - A `failedAt` timestamp
- Dead Letter storage implementation is pluggable and will be fully configured later; the interface must be defined now
- Failed messages must not block or stall the processing of subsequent messages

### Logging
- All log output must be written to **standard out** (stdout)
- Every log entry must include a **correlation ID** set to the `interactionId` from the message's `event` header
- The correlation ID must be bound to the thread context (e.g., MDC) at the point of message receipt and remain in scope for the full processing lifecycle of that message
- Log entries must be structured (e.g., JSON format) and include at minimum: timestamp, log level, correlation ID (`interactionId`), `messageId` (from body where available), and the log message
- Correlation ID must appear in all log entries related to processing, publishing, control record writes, and dead letter routing
- At a minimum, log at key lifecycle points: message received, processing started, publish succeeded, control record written, dead letter routed, and any exceptions

### Query APIs

#### General Rules
- All APIs are REST, returning JSON responses
- All timestamp parameters are ISO-8601 formatted strings (e.g., `2026-03-30T10:00:00Z`)
- `startTimestamp` defaults to **now minus 12 hours** when not provided
- `endTimestamp` is **optional**; when omitted, the query is open-ended (i.e., up to the most recent record)
- All endpoints must add `spring-boot-starter-web` to the application and be served on a configurable port

#### Control Log — Inbound Records
- `GET /api/control/inbound`
- Returns all `ReceivedRecord` entries within the specified time range
- Query parameters:
  - `startTimestamp` (optional, default: now minus 12 hours) — filters on `receivedAt >= startTimestamp`
  - `endTimestamp` (optional, no default) — filters on `receivedAt <= endTimestamp`
- Response fields per record: `messageId`, `interactionId`, `receivedAt`

#### Control Log — Outbound Records
- `GET /api/control/outbound`
- Returns all `PublishedRecord` entries within the specified time range
- Query parameters:
  - `startTimestamp` (optional, default: now minus 12 hours) — filters on `publishedAt >= startTimestamp`
  - `endTimestamp` (optional, no default) — filters on `publishedAt <= endTimestamp`
- Response fields per record: `messageId`, `interactionId`, `publishedAt`

#### Dead Letter Records
- `GET /api/deadletter`
- Returns all `DeadLetterRecord` entries within the specified time range
- Query parameters:
  - `startTimestamp` (optional, default: now minus 12 hours) — filters on `failedAt >= startTimestamp`
  - `endTimestamp` (optional, no default) — filters on `failedAt <= endTimestamp`
- Response fields per record: `messageId`, `interactionId`, `reasonCode`, `rawPayload`, `failedAt`

## Configuration
- Kafka bootstrap servers, input topic, output topic, `groupId`, and consumer concurrency must all be externally configurable under the `kafka.*` namespace (e.g., `application.yml` / environment variables)
- Application-specific settings that are not part of Kafka must be externalized under the `app.*` namespace to clearly distinguish them from Kafka/Spring internals:
  - `app.processing.delay-ms` — delay before processing each message (default: `20000`)
  - `app.processing.worker-threads` — size of the scheduled executor thread pool per instance (default: `240`)
- API server port must be externally configurable (`server.port`)
- No hardcoded Kafka or environment-specific values in source code

## Non-Functional
- Application must be stateless to support horizontal scaling across 10 instances
- Graceful shutdown must drain in-flight messages before stopping consumers
